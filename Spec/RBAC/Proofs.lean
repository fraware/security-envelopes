# RBAC Formal Proofs

This module contains formal proofs of security properties for the RBAC system:
- Soundness: All granted permissions are valid
- Completeness: All valid permissions are granted
- Non-interference: Role changes don't affect other principals
- Decidability: Permission checking terminates
